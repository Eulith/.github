# Welcome To Eulith
We enable sophisticated funds to implement systematic DeFi strategies safely & reliably. 

## ✍️ With a few lines of Python, you can...
⦿ **Open leveraged short (on-chain)** - Ask us about "The Honest Short"

⦿ **Arbitrage without collateral requirements** (flash loans, atomic transactions)

⦿ **Construct atomic transactions** - Combine any set of transactions into 1 transaction. Everything fails, or everything succeeds

⦿ **Access best-execution** - Concurrently get quotes from 1inch, 0x, etc. set your own slippage, recipient, and other parameters

⦿ **"Wuphf" your transaction** - Be resilient against any single RPC provider going down. We route your trades to the largest network clusters around the globe. 

⦿ **Avoid MEV risks** - Easily manage MEV tradeoffs with optional private mempool routing, atomic transaction units, and speedy transaction routing.

⦿ **Sign with your custody** - AWS KMS, HSM, Fireblocks, and GnosisSafe. Signing happens client side. We never see or have access to your keys.

⦿ **Customize to your trade** - It takes 12 seconds to add a token to your trading scope, DIY, no need to call us.

⦿ **Unleash full protocol power** - Get quotes for Uniswap pool without the tick math, execute flash loans, stream prices, and more

⦿ **Screen for AML/Middleman/FatFinger risks** - Do a full simulation of your tx before you sign and send. Set policies to approve or deny based on dozens of risk parameters

⦿ **Trade on your chain** - (ETH, AVAX, POLY, OPT, ARB, BSC). We can add any EVM based network in 20 minutes.
